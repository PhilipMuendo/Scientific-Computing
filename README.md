# Python Fundamentals: Data Types, Control Structures, and Modular Functions

This repository contains three Python scripts (`datatypes.py`, `control_structures.py`, and `modular_functions.py`) that demonstrate fundamental Python concepts.

## Objectives

* **`datatypes.py`:**
    * To create variables of various Python data types (int, float, complex, list, tuple, dict, set, bool).
    * To use the `type()` function to inspect variable types.
    * To perform type conversions between integers and floats.

* **`control_structures.py`:**
    * To practice using `if/else` statements for conditional logic.
    * To implement `for` loops for iterating and generating lists.
    * To utilize `while` loops for repetitive tasks with a condition.
    * To create a function for code reusability.
    * To practice exception handling.

* **`modular_functions.py`:**
    * To design a modular function that calculates the area of different shapes.
    * To use default function parameters.
    * To handle different input scenarios within a single function.
    * To use the `math` module.
    * To practice creating test cases within the main function.

 How to Run the Scripts

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    * If you have cloned this repository, navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
3.  **Run the Scripts:**
    * Open a terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to the directory where the scripts are located.
    * Execute the scripts using the following commands:
        * `python datatypes.py`
        * `python control_structures.py`
        * `python modular_functions.py`
    * Follow the prompts that appear in the terminal, if applicable.
 What I Learned

This exercise reinforced several key concepts in Python programming:

1. Data Types:** I gained a better understanding of Python's built-in data types and how to use them. I also learned about type conversion.
2. Control Flow:** I gained a deeper understanding of how `if/else`, `for`, and `while` statements control the flow of execution in a program.
3. Function Design:** I learned how to create modular functions that perform specific tasks, improving code organization and reusability.
4. Default Parameters:** I practiced using default function parameters to provide flexibility in function calls.
5. Error Handling:** I implemented `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors, making the scripts more robust.
6. Code Organization:** I practiced organizing code into logical functions and using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
7. Math Module:** I learned how to use the `math` module and its `pi` constant for accurate calculations.
8. Test Cases:** I learned how to create test cases within the main function to confirm the functions are performing as expected.
9. Case Insensitivity:** I learned how to handle various user inputs by making the program case insensitive.
